## Academic Program Manager view point - Unit 3

Welcome to ECSE 321 - Winter 2019 project - Group 19 edition.

Please check the wiki for information on the architecture of the system and how to use it.

App hosted [here](https://cooperator-backend-260.herokuapp.com/)

## Scope of Project:
  The Co-Operator application is designed to seamlessly integrate a co-op program into the McGill software engineering degree. The application shall allow a mixture of McGill students, staff and prospective employers to interact in order efficiently keep track of students progress in the program. The Co-Operator application provides a hub for is a tool to help McGill track student progress and administrate the system. Students involved in the program will be taking multiple semesters to work in the industry, aptly named "Co-Op semesters". The scope of the software engineering group project of the Winter 2019 offering of ECSE321 is to develop the software system for managing co-op terms for such co-op program
  
  Our application supports the scenarios described in the user story for the Co-Op Academic program manager and the Co-Op Term Instructor. Additionally this application is designed to integrate with the viewpoints of other stake-holders created by seperate teams via service calls. 3. All functionality of the system is to be accessible via the web frontend for respective stakeholders. In addition,a mobile (Android) frontend allows easy execution of the most important functionality for the givenstakeholder having both read and write access to the backend viaRESTful service call.
